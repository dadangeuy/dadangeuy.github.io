Recently, I have a new goal in mind: to start a blog!

I was inspired by other, fellow engineers:
- [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/) (react co-author, facebook engineer)
- [Tri Ahmad Irfan](https://irfan.blog/) (my old manager, lumina cto)
- [Rakina Zata Amni](https://blog.rakina.fyi/) (my resume savior, google engineer)

I know that I may not have an impact as big as them and this blog won't gain much traffic.

But, let's stop with the negativity. My objective is simple: improve English; satisfy my thirst for roasting, gossip & 
sarcasm; and leave behind something worth to remember!

Now the question is, why don't I use famous, simpler platform such as [Medium](https://medium.com/) or 
[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)? Instead, why do I go with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) & 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) route, which is (relatively) difficult to setup?

It's simple: `difficult to setup == tech savvy`! ðŸ˜‚
