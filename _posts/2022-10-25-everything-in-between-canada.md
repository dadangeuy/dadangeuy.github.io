[stuck with u](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2jvHynuMjI)

Just finished filling an immigration survey a moments ago.

Took my time to reflect on all the things that went wrong these past year...

I'd never imagined that it will take a whole year to get a permit.

I should be able to go next year, given that the journey is smooth ahead.

I should have done a proper research of the process on the beginning.

I should have been actively follow-up the immigration agent every week.

I shouldn't have resigned too early (or do it earlier if I know it would take a long time).

I shouldn't have told too many peoples about it (fly-under-the-radar plan got ruined because of one ðŸ’© person).

I'm stuck in between, what can I do about it? ðŸ˜•
