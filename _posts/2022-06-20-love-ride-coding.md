I'd like to concept this blog around 3 core values that define me: Love💖, Ride🛵 & Coding👨‍💻

I hope with this concept, I can make my writing more consistent and keep it interesting

# Love

The personal stuff, full of emotions! Love doesn't always translate to love for partner/gf. Love for friends
and self-love also counts. Now I sound like Kanye, because no one loves Kanye as much as Kanye loves Kanye 💏.

# Ride

Journey to the unknown! Initially, this is about me travelling with my motorcycle... But, i'll soon lose
it 😭, so I wanted to expand the definition. With or without a motorcycle, the spirit is always
about dare to do the unknown and overcame the fear! Especially with my relocation abroad, it'll be a
hellish ride because everything is unknown... 😨

# Coding

Daily money grinding activity... I do work and have passion in it, and would like to share my thought about it.
Although for real-serious stuff, I prefer to put it on [medium](https://medium.com/@dadangeuy), for the sake of
publishing under my company's name, take the fame, and milk the views 🤫.

💖, 🛵 & 👨‍💻
