[winter is coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43rretY8xwk)

how do you prepare for something that you have never seen before?

do a research, take a guess!

and end up broke...

i'd never expect that a single winter inner-pants would cost 400K IDR 🤬

the closest i have ever feel to winter was when i climb mt. penanggungan, which reach around 5-10°c at night

and i could sleep comfortably without a sleeping bag!

but toronto is a different beast, the temperature in december-february can reach -30°c!! 🥶

facing unknown danger, i'm faced with 2 options

burn more money to stay warm 💸

or grow a winter fur like a husky 🐺
