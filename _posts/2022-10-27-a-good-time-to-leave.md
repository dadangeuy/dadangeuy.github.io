[never a good time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyfbQDYVvPs)

Is there such a good time to leave?

I should have leave when you said it's platonic.

I should have leave when you asked me to after graduation.

I should have leave when you pointed out a knife towards me.

I should have leave when you get drunk with other guy in your room twice.

I should have leave when you let the other guy kissed you.

I should have leave when you asked to break up with me in less than 24 hour that we date.

I should have leave when you said you don't want to get married and only want dogs.

I should have leave when you said that you don't feel any attraction/affection towards me.

I should have leave when you wrote that you wanted to kill me.

I should have leave when I moved out from the place that we live together.

I should have leave when you said that hug/cuddle is a normal thing you do with everyone.

I should have leave when you said you wanted to see how ruined my life is behind my back.

I should have leave when you said you're proud in front, yet loathe it behind my back.

I should have leave when I spot you with him in the morning with lights off after even though we're in a relationship.

I should have leave before this gets too long.
