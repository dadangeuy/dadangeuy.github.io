schizophrenic dialogue 🤷‍♂️

> sorry, i had to take you

> can't stand seeing you upstairs, alone, feeling alienated

> true, i had no rights, yet i just can't

> it may not be the best, but i really tried to do better (damn, i sound selfish)

> i didn't run away from any of recent controversies, and i've tried to talk this one out

> it doesn't work, i was the one being left out in the dark

> agreed, i should do a better job on communicating things

> both past and present, there's always something missing, "feeling loved"

> she didn't, that's what she said straight in front of my face

> i can't be like you rangga, it's hard to love someone that doesn't love you back

> sometimes i wonder, do i only have value when i'm gone?

> yeah, let's go to our sanctuary
