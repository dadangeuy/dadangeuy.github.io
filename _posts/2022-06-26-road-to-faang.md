# Introduction

FAANG is an abbreviation of top software engineering companies: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.

I got the opportunity to exchange learning material with a dear friend and the HR itself!

From my observation, for SDE role, there are 4 areas that will be judged in each round of interviews: Behavioral,
Algorithm & Data Structure, System Design and Object-oriented Design.

# Behavioral

Each company has different value. Amazon, for example, has [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)
and the interview question will revolve around it. Make sure to research about the company's value!

One thing they have in common is, you need to think outside the engineering stuff! Try to think like a Product Manager 
(PM). Spend time talking with your current PM, dig through Product Requirement Design (PRD) of current and past
project. Make sure you understand the reasoning, goals, success metrics, your contribution and the end result.

To avoid convoluted talk, answer with [Situation, Task, Action, Result (STAR)](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629)
format.

# Algorithm & Data Structure

Algorithm & Data Structure is the absolute standard in interview. There are peoples that like to learn in BFS way
(covering as many topics as possible), meanwhile I like to learn in DFS way (deepening knowledge in one topic before
moving to another).

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is the perfect platform if you like to learn in BFS way! They offer a compilation
of FAANG questions (if you're willing to pay). The best part is, you might encounter the same problem during the
interview, who knows? ü§´

[uHunt](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/) is the perfect platform if you like to learn in DFS way! It groups the problems
by topics (covering all fundamental CS topics) and show the difficulty level of each problem! This way, you can
learn from the easy-to-hard one. It takes time, but eventually worth it üëç.

# System Design

System Design will play an important role for an experienced/senior position. The key is to understand every possible
solution and their trade-off. The rest is just convincing the interviewer that your solution does make sense üòÇ.

[System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) offers a quick glance at distributed system
architecture. To complement it, try to imitate how [Gaurav Sen](https://www.youtube.com/c/GauravSensei) build his
argument. I personally prefer [Mikhail Smarshchok](https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemDesignInterview) though,
but he hasn't upload any video since 2019 üò≠.

# Object-oriented Design

Object-oriented design question typically is not as hard as algorithm & data structure question. The main goal is to see
how you organize your code. Applying design pattern will help you create an organized and easy-to-understand design.

[Java Design Patterns](https://java-design-patterns.com/) offers a quick glance at variety of design pattern with its
Java implementation. Note that if you're not a Java user, some of these pattern might not be applicable.

There is also a section of [System Design Primer: Object-oriented design interview questions with solutions](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#object-oriented-design-interview-questions-with-solutions)
to test out your skill.
