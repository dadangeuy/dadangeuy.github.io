Being a grown-up is painful.

It used to be simple.

Me, you, we have fun in our own world.

Now? everything seems sensitive.

You can't please everyone, I know.

Try to open up? someone will hate you for it.

Close your heart and maintain a distance? good luck living through that.

Here I am, trying to fit myself in this changing world.

Pondering, do I need to keep doing this? or just cherish what I had today? 

A question for another day.
