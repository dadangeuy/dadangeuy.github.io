[bye bye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0j4wMr4UI)

### The Perfect Recipe

Started this year with a resolution to create something that I can remember.

Capturing moments as much as I can.

Crafting video in my spare time. 

Carefully pick music that can represent what I feel.

> We're just staying 'cause we're scared to be lonely

> I got my reasons but I get caught in my feelings and I don't wanna say bye

I thought this could be my perfect recipe.

### The Impending Disaster

Later, I realize that this might turn into a disaster.

I don't want my work to be thrown into trash again.

I don't want to get threaten with death again.

It represents my feelings toward peoples that I care about.

Why do you have to make everything about you?

### The Acknowledgement

At the end of the day, it's my fault.

You have every right with your own property.

I throw away all these project into my head.

Letting these unusable footage rot away in my memories.

_p.s. now you know why i refused your gift_
